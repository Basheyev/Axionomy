# Axionomy

**Axionomy** is an educational simulator - a web-based game designed to teach the fundamentals of business and startup management through interactive market and agent-based simulation.

The project combines a **high-performance C++ simulation server** with a **JavaScript browser client**, creating a responsive, data-driven world where markets, firms, and households evolve dynamically over time.

## Vision

Axionomy is an agent-based economic simulation where each firm and household operates under 
information asymmetry and bounded rationality, reacting with delays and imperfect expectations.

Agents interact through markets of offering forming prices and trading 
volumes under financial constraints and uncertainty. Economic outcomes are emergent: innovation, 
incentives, and expectations can drive growth or trigger crises, and equilibrium is a rare 
and fragile state.

The conceptual foundation is inspired by Nobel-recognized contributions to economics, 
including bounded rationality (Simon, 1978), real-market price formation (V. Smith, 2002), 
emergent coordination (Schelling, 2005), information asymmetry (Stiglitz, 2001), behavioral 
finance (Shiller, 2013), incentive design (Holmström, 2016), and endogenous technological 
change (Romer, 2018).

The simulator models a realistic startup economy where the player builds and manages a 
company in a living market environment. The goal is to teach the logic of business formation, 
supply chains, pricing, and financial management through experimentation rather than theory.

## Purpose

Axionomy is built to teach **startup thinking and systems reasoning**.  
Players experience firsthand how pricing, finance, and operations interact - learning by managing uncertainty, not memorizing formulas.
